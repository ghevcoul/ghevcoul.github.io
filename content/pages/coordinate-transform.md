A Python script for converting between coordinate systems commonly used
in materials science. Converts between the Cartesian and fractional
coordinate systems. Takes an input file with the number of atoms,
lattice vectors, and atomic positions in either Cartesian (extension
".cart") or fractional (extension ".frac") coordinates. Prints a new
file with other set of coordinates.

Can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ghevcoul/coordinateTransform) with example
input files for both accepted coordinate systems.
