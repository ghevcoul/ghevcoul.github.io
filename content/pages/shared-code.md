[Matrix algebra
functions](http://www.quantumgeranium.com/shared-code/matrix-algebra-functions/ "Matrix Algebra Functions")
- A collection of basic matrix algebra functions I have written for
various projects.

[Coordinate
transform](http://www.quantumgeranium.com/shared-code/coordinate-transform/ "Coordinate Transform")
- A utility to convert the structures of periodically repeating
materials between Cartesian and fractional coordinates.

[Potential energy surfaces for shearing
materials](http://www.quantumgeranium.com/shared-code/potential-energy-surfaces-for-shearing-materials/ "Potential Energy Surfaces for Shearing Materials")
- A collection of scripts for building a potential energy surface of a
material under shear. Useful for determining optimal shear paths.
