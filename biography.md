subtitle: More than you ever needed to know about me

I came to a career in tech and living in California via a rather circuitous route.
Having grown up in Vermont, I chose to move north to do my undergraduate in chemistry a Bishop's University in the Eastern Townships of Quebec.
While studying chemistry, I used nearly all my electives to take computer science courses, ending up a few shy of completing a minor.
I quickly came to realize that I didn't particularly enjoy experimental chemistry (nor was I very good at it, as my lack of fingerprints for most of my 20s will attest), but I still had a great experience in the Bishop's chemistry department.
It is a small department, only four to five professors, and that was I needed at that point in my life.
Coming to university from a town of less than 1000 people and a graduating high school class of 150 drawn from a half dozen towns, I know I would have gotten lost in large program and lectures as large as my high school.
At Bishop's, every professor in the department knew me by the end of my first year and I flourished under their guidance and support.

As I was completing my bachelors degree, my professors pointed me toward [computational chemistry](/blog/gay-lussac-kohn-pople) for grad school, knowing that it would be a good fit.
This led me to the research group of the inimitable [Russ Boyd](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/chemistry/faculty-staff/our-faculty/emeritus-professors/russell-boyd.html) at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
This turned out to be exactly what I wanted, both the research experience and the city.
I loved living in Halifax - the people, the food, the ocean, the walkability.
Additionally, I loved the experience of working in computational sciences research.
This was my first experience using the high performance computing clusters, which I don't think gets enough recognition in industry as another form of distributed cloud computing.
I quickly became comfortable spending most of my day on the command line SSHed into remote systems that might be in the next room or the other side of the continent.
Everything I could automate about my work with bash scripts I did - I still live by the guiding principle of trying to automate myself out of every job I have.
When I ran up against the limitations of bash scripting, I learned Python and was able to push my work even further.
Moreover, I learned quantum chemistry and was reminded of why I chose to study chemistry in the first place.
In high school chemistry, it was never the lab work the prompted me to major in it, but the deep understanding of [how the world around me works](/blog/salted-water).
Quantum mechanics and a deeper understanding of the atomistic world gave me a whole new appreciation for the sciences.
Even though I now haven't worked in chemistry for six years, not a day goes by that I don't look at some aspect of my life through that lens.

Coming out of my PhD, I was certain that I wanted to follow a career in academia, so I did the next sensible thing and started a postdoctoral fellowship with [Nick Mosey](http://moseygroup.ca/index.html) at Queen's University.
This continued my work in computational chemistry, albeit this time with a more materials science focus.
Moreso than then chemistry I was doing, my postdoc gave me yet another opportunity to grow as a software developer.
My research group did all their work with an open source simulation package called [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) and frequently made modifications to support new research.
As I did my project, we came across a paper detailing a new simulation technique that was perfect for what I needed to do, but hadn't been added to Quantum ESPRESSO yet, so I got to spend a few months digging into this large Fortran codebase and implement this new method.
The other major thing that happened while doing my postdoc (other than meeting my wonderful spouse, that is) was that I came to realize an academic career wasn't what I wanted.
