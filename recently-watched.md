In the spirit of the [Incomparable's](https://www.theincomparable.com/) [Recently Read](https://www.theincomparable.com/recentlyread/) podcast, here is a collection of my thoughts on TV and movies I've recently watched. Like my [recently read](/recently-read), these will be short musings, written shortly after I've watched them. Mostly, I think my family is getting tired of hearing me over-analyse the TV we watch together, so this will give me an outlet for it. These will be collected in reverse chronological order, so the most recent postings will always be at the top. 

## Designated Survivor, seasons 1-3

Anyone who has heard me talk about books or TV long enough will know that I can be very forgiving of the flaws in a work if it starts from a premise I find interesting - Designated Survivor is a show that fits this mold perfectly. 
The show is based on the practice started during the Cold War of the [designated survivor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_survivor).
When the entire presidential line of succession is in a room together for events like the State of the Union, one person in the line is chosen as the "designated survivor" and is kept away from the event in an undisclosed location in case something happens. 

Designated Survivor starts the night of the State of the Union address with Tom Kirkman, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, watching the speech on TV from a safe location. 
Then the unthinkable happens and the US Capitol building explodes, killing the President, Vice President, Cabinet, Congress, and Supreme Court. 
The first season of the show follows the newly inaugurated President Kirkman, a man who had never run for any elected office, attempting to completely rebuild the US government and track down who was behind the attack on the Capitol. 
From the very beginning, I was skeptical how long they could draw out this concept. 
It seemed like a good idea for a mini-series, but how could they maintain this as a multi-season TV series?

In the end, I did enjoy the first season of the show, as a fast moving political thriller about a person thrust into a job he was wholly unprepared for finding his way. 
The second season, which begins a year after the bombing, became a middling political drama.
It still had Kirkman unsure how to do the job of president, but without the excitement of it being the first weeks or months in the role.
The third season actually got better again, due in part to it no longer being produced by ABC, but by Netflix instead. 
In this final season, we follow Kirkman running for re-election as an Independent in the first political race of his life. 
Owing to it no longer being a network TV show, this season explores many interesting topics, such as trans rights, assisted suicide, addiction and the opioid crisis, immigration, and bioterrorism.
