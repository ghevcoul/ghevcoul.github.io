You're invited to celebrate Christmas on Boxing Day with Gavin and Genevieve. We're thinking a low-key post-Christmas gathering to replace all those family feelings (good and bad). We'll be providing a whole pile of waffles, bring your favourite topping to share. 

### Please [RSVP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BWIjHSnlcU57CBOhr_czX3uBXRfD860gK9xsuKEVLi0/edit?usp=sharing) by Monday November 19, so we can get final numbers and plan accordingly.

## When

Monday December 26, 2022 at 11:30 am

## Where

* 135 11th Street, New Westminster
* Apartment 101
* Buzzer code: 115

## What should I bring?

We will be providing _so many_ waffles. 
Please come with waffle toppings to share and make our delicious waffles even better.

If you have a waffle maker, please bring it so we can make waffles faster.
