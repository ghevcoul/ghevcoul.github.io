Whether you love it or hate it, this time of year can be hard, what with the family and hearing Christmas carols for 2 months straight and so much joviality. 

To help you through all those feelings (whatever they are), we're hosting a low-key post-Christmas gathering on Boxing Day. 
We'll be providing a whole pile of waffles, bring your favourite topping to share. 

For those wishing to participate, we're also planning an entirely optional [white elephant gift exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange). 
Just something small, homemade preferred, that you think someone else would love. 

### Please [RSVP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BWIjHSnlcU57CBOhr_czX3uBXRfD860gK9xsuKEVLi0/edit?usp=sharing) by Monday December 19, so we can get final numbers and plan accordingly.

## When

Monday December 26, 2022 at 11:30 am

## Where

* 135 11th Street, New Westminster
* Apartment 101
* Buzzer code: 115

## What should I bring?

We will be providing _so many_ waffles. 
Please come with waffle toppings to share and make our delicious waffles even better.

If you'd like to participate, also bring a white elephant gift.

If you have a waffle maker, please bring it so we can make waffles faster. Our 20 year old one can only go so fast.

Have you RSVPed yet? If not, [go here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BWIjHSnlcU57CBOhr_czX3uBXRfD860gK9xsuKEVLi0/edit?usp=sharing) to do so.
