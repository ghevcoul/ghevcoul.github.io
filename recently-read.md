In the spirit of the [Incomparable's](https://www.theincomparable.com/) [Recently Read](https://www.theincomparable.com/recentlyread/) podcast, a collection of short, off-the-cuff thoughts about books generally written within a few days of finishing them. 
I will endeavour to keep these spoiler-light, any story beats I give away will be limited to the first few chapters of the book. 

# [Six Wakes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28962996-six-wakes) by Mur Lafferty - Dec 2020

If I had to give a summary of this story it would be: 
"A murder mystery where six clones wake up in fresh bodies to find their previous selves murdered. 
They are the only crew of a generation ship a couple decades from Earth. 
They must figure out which of them is the killer."

I was immediately captivated by this story and the world-building to establish the society these people come from. 
It is the ultimate bottle episode, these six people have been on a ship together for decades, but when their clones awake they have no memories since arriving on the ship.
We learn more about the crew and meet each other as they do, approaching everyone as a potential murderer. 

I like how constrained the story is, the whole book takes place over the course of only a few days with all the action in a few rooms of the spaceship. 
But, at the same time, it manages to be expansive.
Delving into ideas of the ethics of cloning, what is "the self" when you've lived hundreds of years across many bodies, are people be defined by their past or can they move past it (especially when that past might be centuries ago).
