# What can I do?

I currently work at [HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/) as a software developer, focusing on scalable geospatial algorithms and data pipelines.
In my time at HERE, I've worked in algorithm development, filed for a US patent, maintained webapps and pipelines with internal users, and owned the CI/CD process for a production data engineering application.
Starting my career there in the Research organization, I spent a few years focused on using GPS probe data for map maintenance and real-time traffic prediction, culminating in a project to predict road closures from probe data which was published in a [special issue of the ACM journal TSAS](https://doi.org/10.1145/3325912) and a [patent application](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20200105134).
After that, I left the Research organization and participated in the development of a change detection pipeline using sensor data from vehicles to detect missing or changed map features on the road. 
More recently, I joined a team building a streaming location data processing application using Flink and Scala.
On that project, I have owned the project's CI/CD pipeline in Gitlab and built out our deployment process on Kubernetes.
