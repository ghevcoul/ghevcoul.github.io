The “chemical-free” movement has been getting increased attention in the
media and many companies have begun labelling their products as such.
This is a dangerous trend, in my opinion, because it is rooted in fear
and fundamental misconceptions about science. The International Union of
Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines
[chemophobia](http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro/iupacglossary/glossaryc.html) as
an “irrational fear of chemicals”. Due to the inherently irrational
nature of chemophobia, the best way to combat it is through education.
With a basic understanding of chemistry, many of these issues can easily
be understood for what they are.

When confronted with chemophobia and “chemical-free” products, an easy
knee-jerk reaction is to respond with sarcasm, as depicted in a
recent^‡^ [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3324). I, too, have been known to
respond to “chemical-free” claims with incredulity. “This product is
chemical free! How is this simple cardboard box containing a vacuum?”
However, this is not a productive way to react to such claims, instead
we should attempt to understand where these ideas are coming from and
work to clear up any misconceptions. Additionally, as chemists, we need
to accept that the language we use differs from that of the general
public.

When we say something is a chemical, we mean that it is made from atoms
(i.e., everything). Non-scientists have a different understanding of the
word. The Oxford English Dictionary [definition of chemical](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/chemical)
is “a distinct compound or substance, especially one which has been
artificially prepared or purified”, clearly a different understanding of
the term. I'm not going to say that one understanding is right and one
is wrong. Both are equally correct, but they stem from fundamental
differences in how the world is viewed.

To that end, I would like to start a project, where I will periodically
write posts on the claims made by the “chemical-free” folks where I dig
into the science behind the issue. This will be a rational examination
of the issue, sometimes we'll find that they have made the right choice
(although not always for the right reasons), other times we'll look at
unfounded claims and where they originate from. My hope is to provide a
bit of hard science in an area that is all too often dominated by
pseudoscience and fear.

nearly three months ago, so today we have learned my brain's idea of
recent is not to be trusted.
